OML : Orbit Measurment Library : Installation instructions
==========================================================

For users
---------

If you just want to use OML, you probably downloaded this package as a
tarball. The standard UNIX ./configure && make method works for this
package. Here's what to do:

$ tar xvfz oml2-2.x.x.tar.gz
$ cd oml2-2.x.x
$ ./configure --help

(to see the configuration options), and then:

$ ./configure [possible options]
$ make
$ make install							# As super user, or use sudo(1)

The most useful option to configure is the --prefix option, which allows
installation in a non-standard location. The default is /usr/local. If
you just use the default, the liboml2 library will be installed in
/usr/local/lib, and you should be able to link your programs against it
with a simple -loml2 on the command line to the linker. The server,
proxy server, and oml2_scaffold will be installed in /usr/local/bin, and
should be in your standard PATH. The example programs and the programs
in the app/ subdirectory will be installed in /usr/local/share/bin.

To install OML in your home directory, use:

$ ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/usr		# For example
$ make
$ make install

Then you will probably need to add ${HOME}/usr/lib to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. The 'make install' process will
print instructions on what to do. To run the server, add ${HOME}/usr/bin
to your PATH environment variable

By default the documentation will be built. The documentation is written
in Asciidoc markup language, so you'll need Asciidoc installed ('apt-get
install asciidoc' on Debian/Ubuntu). Code documentation based on Doxygen
markup is also generated. To disable building the documentation, use the
'--with-doc' option to the configure script. To only disable Doxygen
documentation, use the '--without-doxygen-doc' option.

$ ./configure --without-doc
$ make								# This now doesn't builds the docs
$ make install							# As super user, or use sudo(1)

The last command will install the man pages. Starting points in the
documentation are:

$ man 1 liboml2
$ man 3 liboml2
$ man 5 liboml2.conf

All functions in the API have their own man pages (see liboml2(3) for
starters).

For developers
--------------

If you want to modify or enhance OML, you probably checked out the
sources from the OML git repository at

$ git clone git://mytestbed.net/oml.git

In that case, in order to build the package you first need to generate
the configure script and Makefiles. To do this you need the Autotools
installed: Autoconf, Automake, and Libtool. If you use a Linux
distribution, these should all be available via your system's package
manager.

Once you have installed the Autotools you should be able to generate all
the necessary configuration and Makefiles by doing this:

$ cd oml2
$ ./autogen.sh

At this point you should be ready to run

$ ./configure && make && make install

as above.

If you want to run the test suite you will also need to install the
CHECK package (a unit testing framework) [0].  It's also available as a
Debian package in the standard Debian and Ubuntu repositories:

$ apt-get install check

If you don't install CHECK then the test suite won't be run, but OML
should still build and install correctly. To run the test suite, use the
'check' target:

$ make check

If you prefer to keep your executables, object files, and other
generated files in a separate tree, Automake supports a parallel build
using GNU Make's VPATH feature. For instance, to build in a subdirectory
called 'build', do the following:

$ cd oml2
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure [possible options]
$ make
$ make install							# As super user, or use sudo(1)

All the files generated by configure and make will be put under the
build directory. Automake recognizes that configure was run in a
directory different to the root of the source tree, and adjusts its
behaviour accordingly.

Finally, if you want to restore the tree to a clean state, without the
generated Makefile, Makefile.in, and copied Autoconf/Automake/Libtool
files, do this:

$ cd oml2
$ ./autoclean.sh

Once you do this, you'll have to follow the above procedure again to get
the tree into a state where you can build it.
