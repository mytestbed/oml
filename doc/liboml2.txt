liboml2 - OML2 client library

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*<oml2-enabled-app>* [APP-OPTIONS] [OML-OPTIONS]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*liboml2* is the client library for OML2.  It provides an API for
application writers to collect measurements from their applications
via user-defined 'Measurement Points' (MPs).  It also provides a
flexible filtering and collection mechanism that allows application
users to customize how measurements are processed and stored by an
OML-enabled application.

This man page documents the command-line user configuration of
OML-enabled applications.  Application writers who want to learn how
to write an application using the *liboml2* API should consult
linkoml:liboml2[3,api].  OML also supports an external configuration file,
documented in linkoml:liboml2.conf[5].

When an OML application starts up, it passes the command line
arguments to *liboml2*, which scans them for options that it
understands, and uses those to configure itself.  *liboml2* then
removes its own options from the command line so that the application
proper does not get confused by them.  All OML options start with the
prefix '--oml-'.  The '--oml-help' option lists all the known OML command
line options.

The command line options recognized by *liboml2* allow for a basic
configuration of the measurement library.  They are adequate for
testing and debugging, but do not offer as much flexibility as the
external configuration file format supports.  You can pass a
configuration file to *liboml2* using the '--oml-config' option.  For
details, see linkoml:liboml2.conf[5].

When no configuration file is given, *liboml2* provides a basic set of
filters for each measurement point, and sends measurements to just one
location (using the '--oml-collect' option).  For each measurement
point, each element of the measurement point's injected tuple is given
its own filter.  The filter created depends on the type of the element
and the current sampling policy.

For instance, suppose a measurement point defined with a measurement tuple
as follows:

----------
MeasurementPoint (name = "link_properties")
("source"      : OML_UINT64_VALUE,
 "destination" : OML_UINT64_VALUE,
 "length"      : OML_INT32_VALUE,
 "snr"         : OML_DOUBLE_VALUE,
 "name"        : OML_STRING_VALUE)
----------

Then *liboml2* will create a separate filter for each of "source",
"destination", "length", "snr", and "name".  The filters for the first
four numeric elements will be an averaging filter (filter type
'avg'), and the last string element will be given a 'first' filter.
The 'first' filter keeps the first injected value in the current
sampling period and throws away all others, passing the first value on
to the measurement output stage.

The exception to this rule is that if '--oml-samples' was given, and
if the argument is 1, then numeric elements are filtered using the
'first' filter, not the averaging filter.

For more information on OML filters and how they are configured, see
the documentation for the configuration file format,
linkoml:liboml2.conf[5]. For more information on measurement points and how
they are defined, see linkoml:liboml2[3,api] and linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3].

MEASUREMENT OUTPUT AND SCHEMAS
------------------------------

Where measurement output of an OML program goes depends on the
collection URI (see link:#_uri_format[URI FORMAT] below). If using the
*tcp* scheme, it is sent to the named linkoml:oml2-server[1], for
storage in an SQL database, while  using the *file* or *flush* schemes
will create a local file with the given name containing OML text mode
protocol which can later on be stream (e.g., using link:netcat[1]) to an
*oml2-server*. Measurement points are created with a 'schema', as above,
a schema being an ordered list of (name, type) pairs.

OML filters also generate output with a declared schema. For each
measurement point, *liboml2* generates a single output measurement that
is the union of the outputs of all filters attached to the MP.  The
names of the fields (or columns) of the schema are derived from the
names of the original MP fields, and the output schemas of the filters.
The schemas can be observed directly with the *file* collection URI
schemes (e.g., *file:-*) output (identical schemas are sent to the
server when the *tcp* scheme is used).  For instance, here is the output
schema for a simple example MP that measures a string ("label") and an
integer ("seq_no"):

--------
schema: 1 generator_lin label:string seq_no:uint32
--------

The schema name is "generator_lin" -- a combination of the application
name ("generator") and the measurement point name ("lin").  (The
number '1' on this line is an index used in the output columns to
identify a line of measurement with the schema to which it conforms.)
This output was made using '--oml-samples 1' on the command line.
This creates a 'first' filter for both of the fields of the
measurement point.  The 'first' filter outputs a single value that has
the same type as the filter's input.

If we change the command line to use '--oml-samples 2', then an
averaging filter is used for the numeric "seq_no" field ("label" is
unchanged).  The schema therefore changes as well:

--------
schema: 1 generator_lin label:string \
                        seq_no_avg:double \
                        seq_no_min:double \
                        seq_no_max:double
--------

(*liboml2* always emits schemas on a single line, but this schema is
split into several for readability.)

An 'avg' filter picks one field of the MP to filter (in this case
"seq_no") and then produces a 3-tuple as output (avg, min, max).
Therefore *liboml2* creates a schema for this filter output that looks
like:

--------
("seq_no_avg" : OML_DOUBLE_VALUE,
 "seq_no_min" : OML_DOUBLE_VALUE,
 "seq_no_max" : OML_DOUBLE_VALUE)
--------

This is the general pattern for filters:  their output schemas are
formed by appending the name of the source MP with the name of the
filter output field.  (The 'first' filter is an exception in that it
just takes the name of the input field and uses that as the output
field name.)

When a *tcp* collection URI is specified, the received *oml2-server*
creates a database table for each measurement point using the combined
OML output schema as schema for the table.  For instance, the above
example would translate to an SQL CREATE TABLE statement like:

--------
CREATE TABLE generator_lin (label TEXT, seq_no_avg REAL, seq_no_min REAL,
                            seq_no_max REAL);
--------

Note that even though an MP field may have an integral type, it may be
represented as a floating point type in the output because the filter
may output floating point values.  For instance, the average of a set
of integers is real valued because of the division in the averaging
operation.

Another situation may arise when a table by the same name, but with a
different schema, already exists in the target database. In this case,
the linkoml:oml2-server[1] tries to incrementally number the new
table's name (e.g., 'mymp_2', 'mymp_3',... for stream 'mymp'). It
makes 9 attempts at renaming the table before failing. Indeed, it
would be unwise for experiments that use a large number of instances
of the same application with different filter configuration to not
explicitely name each of them. This can be done through the use of a
configuration file, with these 'rename' attribute of the relevant 'mp'
element, see linkoml:liboml2.conf[5].

OML OPTIONS
-----------
--oml-id id::
	Set the OML client's identity to 'id'.  This is used by the
	linkoml:oml2-server[1] to distinguish measurements of the same type from
	different sources (for example, the same application running on a
	different machine).  If '--oml-id' is not given, an error is
	printed and measurement collection will not occur (although the
	application may still run).

--oml-domain domain::
--oml-exp-id domain::
Set the OML client's experimental domain to 'domain'.  This is used by
the linkoml:oml2-server[1] to group measurements from different clients
that logically belong to the same gropu.  Multiple applications running
on different machines can contribute measurements to the same
experiment.  If '--oml-domain' is not given, an error is written to the
log file and measurement collection will not occur (although the
application may still run). The '--oml-exp-id' option is obsolescent,
and '--oml-collect' should be preferred.


--oml-file filename::
Write measurements to file 'filename', in a human readable text format.
This is an exact equivalent to '--oml-collect file:filename', see below.
Only one of '--oml-collect' (or '--oml-server') or'--oml-file' can be
specified at a time. This command line option is obsolescent, and
'--oml-collect' with the *file* scheme should be prefered.

--oml-collect uri::
--oml-server uri::
Send measurements to the OML server specified by the 'uri'.  Only one of
'--oml-collect' or '--oml-server' can be active at a time.  The format
of the 'uri' is described in link:#_uri_format[URI FORMAT] below.  The
'uri' can specify the address and port at which either an *oml2-server*
or an *oml2-proxy-server* is listening. The '--oml-server' option is
obsolescent, and '--oml-collect' should be preferred.

--oml-text::
Encode measurements using text format when writing to either a local
file or a remote server. Text format is easy for scripts to parse, with
one measurement per line, and is the default when a *file* URI scheme is
used. Only one of '--oml-text' and '--oml-binary' should be used on the
same command line.

--oml-binary::
Encode measurements using binary format when writing to either a local
file or a remote server. The binary format is the default when *tcp*
URI scheme is given, and provides better performance.  Only one of
'--oml-text' and '--oml-binary' should be used on the same command line.

--oml-bufsize size (bytes)::
Set the size of internal buffers used by *liboml2*.  There is one
buffer per output destination, and each one is allowed to grow to
roughly this size in bytes.  For various reasons the buffers can grow
a certain amount more than this size, but will still be bounded.
'--oml-bufsize' specifies the lower bound on the maximum buffer size.
The default is 2048 bytes.  If the maximum allowed buffer size is
exceeded, *liboml2* will start dropping measurement data (with a
message in the client log file).  Increasing the buffer size may
prevent this from happening, depending on the application design.

--oml-config file::
Read the contents of 'file' and use them to configure the *liboml2*
client.  See linkoml:liboml2.conf[5] for details of the configuration file
format.  Generally, the configuration taken from 'file' overrides any
equivalents from the command line.  Command line options that cannot
be set using the configuration file are '--oml-log-file',
'--oml-log-level', '--oml-noop'.

--oml-samples count::
Make all measurement point filters produce an output after every 'count'
samples have been injected into them.  Only one of '--oml-samples' and
'--oml-interval' can be given on the same command line.  If neither
'--oml-samples' nor '--oml-interval' are given, then *liboml2* behaves
as if '--oml-samples' was given with an argument of 'count'=1.

--oml-interval seconds::
Make all measurement point filters produce an output periodically with
a time period of 'seconds'.  Only one of '--oml-interval' and
'--oml-samples' can be given on the same command line.

--oml-log-file file::
Write OML logging information to 'file'.  The amount of logging
information recorded is controlled by '--oml-log-level'.

--oml-log-level n::
Record logging information at a level of detail given by 'n', which
should be an integer from 0 to 4.  The defaul level of logging is 0,
which prints 'ERROR', 'WARNING', and 'INFO' messages.  Levels 1 to 4
add gradually larger amounts of debug logging ('DEBUG', 'DEBUG2',
'DEBUG3', 'DEBUG4').  It is possible to set 'n' to -1 for only 'ERROR'
and 'WARNING' logging, or -2 for only 'ERROR' logging.

--oml-noop::
If this option is given, no measurements are collected, and the
application does not attempt to connect to an OML server or write
measurements to file.

--oml-list-filters::
This option prints the available filters to the console and then
quits the application.

--oml-help::
Prints a summary of the available OML options.

URI FORMAT
----------
*liboml2* accepts a 'uri' argument for the '--oml-collect' option that
is similar to an IETF URI (see e.g. RFC3986).  The OML URI consists of
an optional network protocol, a host identifier, and an optional port
number, or a mandatory *file* (or *flush* )scheme and a local filesystem
path.  The format of the network server version is:
---------------------------
		[tcp:][//]<host>[:<port>]
---------------------------
The formats for the local file version is:
---------------------------
		(file|flush):<local-path>
---------------------------

For instance, 'tcp:10.0.0.200:3003' or 'tcp://10.0.0.200:3003' will send
measurements to an *oml2-server* listening on port 3003 at IP address
10.0.0.200, using TCP. The '//' is recognized but optional.  Either an
IP address or a hostname can be used as the '<host>' specifier, and the
'<port>' specifier is optional, defaulting to port 3003. The *tcp*
scheme is the default if this part is omitted.

Alternatively, 'file:/tmp/myfile.txt' writes to the /tmp/myfile.txt file
in the local filesystem. Relative paths are also accepted. There should
be no double-slash after the colon: 'file://myfile.txt' is treated the
same as 'file:/myfile.txt', i.e., it will try to write the output in the
root directory. The special file URL 'file:-' will write output to the
standard output. The *flush* scheme behaves exactly in the same way as
*file* except the file descriptor is flushed after each a measurement
line is written out. This allows to prevent any size-based buffering in
the C library from delaying the recording of samples. This is useful in
case of, e.g., real time graphing of the data based on the contents of
the file.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
---------------------
*liboml2* recognizes the following environment variables.  Note that
the equivalent command line options override any value set in an
environment variable.

OML_NAME::
The name to identify this client to the OML server, equivalent to the
'--oml-id' command line option.

OML_DOMAIN::
OML_EXP_ID::
The name of the experiment to which this client's measurements belong.
Used for grouping measurements into the same database on the server.
Equivalent to the '--oml-domain' command line option. 'OML_EXP_ID' is
obsolescent and kept for backward compatibility.

OML_CONFIG::
The path to the configuration file to use to configure the client.
Equivalent to the '--oml-config' command line option.

OML_COLLECT::
OML_SERVER::
The URI of the server to which the measurements should be sent.  The
value of this environment variable should be a URI in the same format
specified above (link:#_uri_format[URI FORMAT]).  If the URI specifies
the *file* scheme, the measurements are written to the local text
file specified in the URI, rather than being sent to an OML server.
Equivalent to the '--oml-collect' command line option. 'OML_SERVER' is
obsolescent and kept for backward compatibility.

OML_FEATURES::
A comma-separated list of run-time features to enable.  Currently the
following are recognized:
* "default-log-simple" (default): All log output will be sent to stderr
if no log file was selected using --oml-log-file, or if the argument of
--oml-log-file was "-", and the logging will use new-style logging to
stderr.  This means all log messages are prefixed with a label
indicating the severity, i.e., "ERROR", "WARN", "INFO", "DEBUG",
"DEBUG2", etc.

BUGS
----
The selection of the 'first' filter when '--oml-samples 1' is used can
be confusing for numeric MP fields because it results in a different
schema in the measurement output compared to other possible
configurations available from the command line, which use the 'avg'
filter.  It is not clear whether this is a feature or a bug.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------

'oml2-server' does not use any authentication, and should thus be
considered insecure.  It is intended to be deployed behind firewalls
on a dedicated testbed network.  It should not be run as a daemon on
an open network.  Future versions of OML may be re-designed to be
suitable for use in insecure environments.
