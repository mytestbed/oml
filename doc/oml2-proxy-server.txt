NAME
----
oml2-proxy-server - Buffer OML client measurements for later replay
to an upstream server.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*oml2-proxy-server* [-l port | --listen=port] [-r file | --resultfile=file]
      [-s size| --size=size] [-a addr | --dstaddress=addr] [-p port | --dstport=port]
	  [-d level | --debug-level=level] [--logfile=file] [-v | --version]
	  [-? | --help]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*oml2-proxy-server* provides a buffered proxy for the linkoml:oml2-server[1]
for use in situations where either the normal *oml2-server* is not
reachable, or where using a reachable *oml2-server* to store
measurements as they are made would disturb the phenomena being
measured.

The *oml2-proxy-server* listens for OML client connections on the port
given with the -l option, and buffers the subsequent measurement
traffic in memory. When it receives an OML-RESUME command (see below),
*oml2-proxy-server* connects to the upstream *oml2-server* daemon
(specified with the -a and -p options) and then sends all buffered
measurements to the upstream server.

The buffering scheme is very simple: the client measurement streams
are stored in the buffer without translation, and then simply replayed
to the upstream server when the proxy is resumed.  This allows the
*oml2-proxy-server* implementation to be very simple.

The *oml2-proxy-server* listens for the OMLPROXY-PAUSE and
OMLPROXY-RESUME commands on its stdin file descriptor.  The operator
must therefore leave the process attached to an open terminal or pipe
whilst it is running in order to control it.  The commands must be
typed in upper case as listed here, followed by a carriage return
(ENTER key).

The OMLPROXY-PAUSE command pauses the transmission of measurements to
the upstream server.  When *oml2-proxy-server* starts, it is in this
state.

The OMLPROXY-RESUME command resumes transmission of measurements to
the upstream server.

A typical usage scenario is to start the *oml2-proxy-server* and leave
it in the paused state, then conduct measurements, and when
measurement activities have finished, issue the OMLPROXY-RESUME
command to order the proxy server to send measurements to the upstream
OML server.

As well as storing the measurement streams in memory, the
*oml2-proxy-server* also saves them to a file on disk, whose name and
location can be specified with the '-r' option.

OPTIONS
-------
-l port::
--listen=port::
	Listen for connections from OML clients on port (default 3003).

-d level::
--debug-level=level::
	Set the verbosity of the log output to level.  The level should be
	an integer from 1 to 4 (1=ERROR, 2=WARNING, 3=INFO, 4=DEBUG).  The
	default log verbosity is 3, INFO.

--logfile=file::
	Write log messages to the given file.  The default file is
	oml_proxy_server.log.

-r file::
--resultfile=file::
	Save results into the given disk file.  The default result file
	name is oml_result_proxy.log.  If the result file already exists
	then a new one will be created with a unique name based on file.

-s bytes::
--size=bytes::
	Buffer page size in bytes.

-p port::
--dstport=port::
	Upstream server port number (default port is 3003).

-a address::
--dstaddress=address::
	Upstream server address (default is localhost).

-v::
--version::
	Print the version number of *oml2-proxy-server*.

-?::
--help::
	Print a summary of available options.

--usage::
	Display a brief usage message.


BUGS
----
The *oml2-proxy-server* is still experimental software and under
active development.  It may contain bugs, and its interfaces may
change without warning from version to version, even within the 2.x
major release series.  We will strive to keep the interface backwards
compatible for patch-level releases within a minor release series
(i.e. version 2.3.5 should be backwards compatible with 2.3.4), but we
may change the interface between minor release series (e.g. version
2.4.0 might not be backwards compatible with 2.3.5).
