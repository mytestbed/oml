omlc_start(3)
=============

NAME
----
omlc_start - start measurement outputs

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
*#include <oml2/omlc.h>*
[verse]
'int' *omlc_start*('void');

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*omlc_start*() begins the process of measurement sampling and output.
It must be called after any 'measurement points' (MPs) have been
registered with *liboml2* using linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3].  Once *omlc_start*()
has been called, it is valid to call linkoml:omlc_inject[3] to start making
measurements, but it is no longer possible to call linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3].

The main function of *omlc_start*() is to set up the internal data
structures that determine the filtering configuration.  It also starts
threads to periodically generate filter outputs for measurement
streams that are declared using the 'interval' sampling method (see
the '--oml-interval' option in linkoml:liboml2[1] or the 'interval'
attribute in linkoml:liboml2.conf[5]).

If a configuration file is given using the '--oml-config' command line
option or the OML_CONFIG environment variable, then *omlc_start*()
reads the configuration file to determine what filters to create.
Otherwise it creates a set of default filters as follows:

* For each field of each MP, a separate filter is created;
* If the type of the field is a numeric type, then the filter will be
the 'avg' averaging filter, unless the 'samples' method is specified
and the number of samples per filter output is set to 1, in which case
the 'first' filter is used.
* If the type of the field is not a numeric type, then the 'first'
filter is used.

For more details on how filter configuration is done, see linkoml:liboml2[1]
and linkoml:liboml2.conf[5].

Once *omlc_start*() has finished establishing the filter
configuration, it writes headers to the configured output destinations
(local files and/or linkoml:oml2-server[1] daemons).


RETURN VALUE
------------

*omlc_start*() returns 0 on success; on error, a negative value is returned.

ERRORS
------

*omlc_start*() will return < 0 if:

* *liboml2* has not yet been initialized via a call to linkoml:omlc_init[3];
* an error occurred parsing the external config file;
* no config file was given and no output destination was specified on
either the command line or using an environment variable (e.g. no
'--oml-file' and no '--oml-server' command line options);
* there was an error in the specification of the output destination;
* there was an error writing to the output destination stream(s).

The last condition can occur during a call to *omlc_start*() because
the function writes the metadata for the current configuration to all
of the currently configured output streams, either local files
or linkoml:oml2-server[1] daemons.
