DESCRIPTION
-----------

*liboml2* is the client library for OML2.  It provides an API for
application writers to collect measurements from their applications
via user-defined 'Measurement Points' (MPs).  It also provides a
flexible filtering and collection mechanism that allows application
users to customize how measurements are processed and stored by an
OML-enabled application.

This man page summarizes the API.  Each function in the API also has
its own detailed man page.  To learn how to configure an
application that uses the API from the command line, see
linkoml:liboml2[1].  To learn about the external configuration file that
*liboml2* can use, see linkoml:liboml2.conf[5].

A programmer who wants to use *liboml2* to perform measurements in
their application must first decide what to measure. OML lets the
programmer first define 'MPs' and then inject measurement tuples into
them. The core of the library then performs filtering on the injected
measurements and, at predefined times, emits the filtered samples to
either a local file or a measurement server (see linkoml:oml2-server[1]).

A program using OML can therefore be divided into two stages:

Initialization::
First the library is initialized and measurement points are defined.

Measurement::
Second, the filters are constructed and enabled by calling
linkoml:omlc_start[3]. Measurement can proceed, with as many calls to
linkoml:omlc_inject[3] as required. For convenience,
linkoml:oml2-scaffold[1] generates helper functions
(*oml_inject_MPNAME*) which take care of preparing the data and
passing it to linkoml:omlc_inject[3].

It is also best to call linkoml:omlc_close[3] to shut down the measurement
library cleanly once measurement tasks are completed, such as when the
application is terminating.

Initialization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When the application starts up, the programmer should make a call to
linkoml:omlc_init[3] to initialize *liboml2*.  The function accepts a name
for the application itself, together with the executable's command
line arguments (the C *main*() function's *argc* and *argv*
parameters), and a fourth argument which is not widely used and can
safely be set to NULL:

----
#include <oml2/omlc.h>

int main(int argc, const char **argv)
{
  int result = omlc_init ("MyOmlClient", &argc, argv, NULL);
  if (result == -1) {
    fprintf (stderr, "Could not initialize OML\n");
    exit (1);
  }

  /* Do application stuff... */

  return 0;
}
----

The linkoml:omlc_init[3] function gathers configuration information from the
command line arguments, the environment, and possibly an external
configuration file, and sets internal configuration options of the
library.  It removes any command line options that it recognizes, so
that the application itself does not get confused when it tries to
interpret the command line.  All OML options start with the prefix
'--oml-'.  An application should call linkoml:omlc_init[3] _before_ running
its own command line option parser.

After initializing the library, the programmer must define the
application's 'MPs'.  Each 'MP' is defined as a typed tuple.  OML
supports basic integer types, a double-precision floating point type,
and a string type.  Future versions will support blobs, network
addresses, ... etc.  An 'MP' definition is represented as an array of
'OmlMPDef' objects, terminated by a NULL object, as shown here:

----
OmlMPDef mp_def [] =
{
  { "source", OML_UINT32_VALUE },
  { "destination", OML_UINT32_VALUE },
  { "length", OML_UINT32_VALUE },
  { "weight", OML_DOUBLE_VALUE },
  { "protocol", OML_STRING_VALUE },
  { NULL, (OmlValueT)0 }
};
----

The first member of the 'OmlMPDef' struct is the name of the field of
the 'MP' that it represents.  The second member is its type.  The name
appears in the schema for the local file storage, and as part of the
database column name for the database created by linkoml:oml2-server[1].

To register the 'MP' definition with *liboml2*, the programmer must
call linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3]:

----
OmlMP* mp = omlc_add_mp ("packet_info", mp_def);

if (mp == NULL) {
 fprintf (stderr, "Error: could not register Measurement Point 'packet_info'");
 exit (1);
}
----

This function returns a handle to the internal 'MP' object, which
should be used in subsequent calls to linkoml:omlc_inject[3], and
should be treated as opaque.

Measurement
~~~~~~~~~~~

Once all measurement points have been defined and created using calls
to linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3], the programmer must start the measurement
collection process by calling linkoml:omlc_start[3].  This call creates the
internal filters according to the current configuration options, and
starts the filter output sampling threads for \'interval' style
filters (for more information see linkoml:liboml2.conf[5]).  Once
linkoml:omlc_start[3] has been called, no more 'MPs' can be added:  further
calls to linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3] will be ignored.  Conversely, once
linkoml:omlc_start[3] has been called, calls to linkoml:omlc_inject[3] can be made
to perform measurements.

The linkoml:omlc_inject[3] function accepts an 'MP' handle and a vector of
'OmlValueU' objects.  The programmer should first load up the vector
with new values to be measured using the *omlc_set_** macros, and
then call linkoml:omlc_inject[3].  For instance, here is how a measurement
injection might look for the 'MP' definition above:

----
...

OmlMP *mp = omlc_add_mp("packet_info", mp_def);

...

uint32_t source_id;
uint32_t destination_id;
uint32_t packet_length;
double weight;
char *protocol;

...

/* Some application-specific code to obtain new values for the variables above */

...

{
   OmlValueU values[5];

   omlc_set_uint32 (values[0], source_id);
   omlc_set_uint32 (values[1], destination_id);
   omlc_set_uint32 (values[2], packet_length);
   omlc_set_double (values[3], weight);
   omlc_set_string (values[4], protocol);

   omlc_inject (mp, values);
}
----

The vector must be loaded with values in the same order as the
original definition of the fields of the 'MP' in the call to
linkoml:omlc_add_mp[3]. The call to linkoml:omlc_inject[3] can be
repeated as many times as the program wants to make measurements for a
given 'MP'.

Alternatively, linkoml:oml2-scaffold[1] can generate similar helper
injection functions as part of the OML header ('--oml'). Their
prototype is  of the form *oml_inject_MPNAME*('OmlMP*' mp, ...), where
*MPNAME* is the name of the 'MP' that is passed as *mp*. The remaining
arguments are C-typed variables constituting the sample to be injected
in the 'MP'. Apart from safe manipulation of the 'OmlValueU' array,
this also allows to rely on the C compiler to do type-checking and
ensure data of the right type is injected in each field. It is
therefore the recommended approach.

OML Types
~~~~~~~~~

OML defines the following types:

* OML_INT32_VALUE
* OML_UINT32_VALUE
* OML_INT64_VALUE
* OML_UINT64_VALUE
* OML_DOUBLE_VALUE
* OML_STRING_VALUE

Each of the first four integral types maps to an underlying equivalent
type from the C standard header *stdint.h*.  These types should be
used in calls to the *omlc_set_** macros.  They are:

* 'int32_t'
* 'uint32_t'
* 'int64_t'
* 'uint64_t'

The OML_DOUBLE_VALUE type maps to an underlying C double.  The C value
is a compound type, and currently just conveys the pointer to the
caller's object into the *liboml2* library, but the library generally
copies the string into its own memory, so the programmer shouldn't have to
worry about memory management across the API boundary.

*liboml2* currently also defines an OML_LONG_VALUE that maps to a C
'long' type, but this type is deprecated because it can change size
between 32-bit and 64-bit platforms. It will be removed from the API
when OML3 is released. The library internally clamps OML_LONG_VALUE
'MP' fields to the most positive and negative values that will fit in
an 'int32_t' object before sending them to the linkoml:oml2-server[1] or a
local measurement file. OML_LONG_VALUE should not be used in new
applications.

Building
~~~~~~~~
Applications using *liboml2* must include the '-loml2' flag on the
linker command line to link against the client library.

EXAMPLE
-------

The following is a fully-functional example application that counts
from 1 to 1000 and outputs the value of the counter as an unsigned
integer, a string, and a double at each step:

--------
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <oml2/omlc.h>

int main (int argc, const char **argv)
{
  int result = omlc_init ("Simple", &argc, argv, NULL);
  if (result == -1) {
    fprintf (stderr, "Could not initialize OML\n");
    exit (1);
  }

  OmlMPDef mp_def [] = {
    { "count", OML_UINT32_VALUE },
    { "count_str", OML_STRING_VALUE },
    { "count_real", OML_DOUBLE_VALUE },
    { NULL, (OmlValueT)0 }
  };

  OmlMP *mp = omlc_add_mp ("counter", mp_def);

  if (mp == NULL) {
    fprintf (stderr, "Error: could not register Measurement Point 'counter'");
    exit (1);
  }

  omlc_start();

  int i = 0;
  for (i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    uint32_t count = (uint32_t)i;
    char count_str[16];
    double count_real = (double)i;
    OmlValueU values[3];

    snprintf(count_str, sizeof(count_str), "%d", i);

    omlc_set_uint32 (values[0], count);
    omlc_set_string (values[1], count_str);
    omlc_set_double (values[2], count_real);

    omlc_inject (mp, values);
  }

  omlc_close();

  return 0;
}
--------

The following command should be sufficient to compile this
program:

--------
$ gcc -o counter counter.c -loml2
--------

Here is an example command line to run this application with a default
set of filters:

--------
$ ./counter --oml-id myid --oml-domain count --oml-collect file:-
--------

The output from this command will appear on the terminal because we told
OML to use the standard output ('--oml-collect file:-').  Here is what
it looks like:

An easy way to create more complicated applications is to
use linkoml:oml2-scaffold[1].
