@misc{2013mehani_instrumentation_framework,
    abstract = {Experimentation for research on the future Internet involves observing multiple
metrics at various distributed points of the network under observa- tion. Be it
in a testbed or in an uncontrolled field experiment, collecting these
measurements is not an easy task. The relevant experimental data tends to be
scattered across multiple hosts in different, incompatible formats, and
sometimes buried amongst a trove of other measurements, irrelevant to the
current question. Collecting, selecting and formatting the useful records is a
time-consuming manual operation. In this paper, we present a conceptual
framework to facilitate this task. It includes a common representation of any
type of experimental data, as well as the elements to process and collect the
measurement samples. We then introduce the OML suite, an instrumen- tation
library following the concept of this framework. We outline its API and how it
can be used to instrument an experiment in only a few lines of code. We also
present an evaluation of this library, demonstrating that it can be used
non-intrusively with respect to the processes and systems under observation, as
well as confirming the validity of the proposed framework.},

@article{2012mehani_oml_performance,
    abstract = {In all measurement campaigns, one needs to assert that the instrumentation
tools do not significantly impact the system being monitored. This is critical
to future claims based on the collected data and is sometimes overseen in
experimental studies. We propose a method to evaluate the potential "observer
effect" of an instrumentation system, and apply it to the OMF Measurement
Library (OML). OML allows the instrumentation of almost any software to collect
any type of measurements. As it is increasingly being used in networking
research, it is important to characterise possible biases it may introduce in
the collected metrics. Thus, we study its effect on multiple types of reports
from various applications commonly used in wireless research. To this end, we
designed experiments comparing OML-instrumented software with their original
flavours. Our analyses of the results from these experiments show that, with an
appropriate reporting setup, OML has no significant impact on the instrumented
applications, and may even improve some of their performances in specifics
cases. We discuss our methodology and the implication of using OML, and provide
guidelines on instrumenting off-the-shelf software.},

    abstract = {Networking researchers using testbeds containing mobile nodes face the problem of measurement collection from disconnected nodes. We solve this problem efficiently by adding a proxy server to the Orbit Measurement Library (OML) to transparently buffer measurements on disconnected nodes, and we give results showing our solution in action. We then add a flexible filtering and feedback mechanism on the server that enables a tailored hierarchy of measurement collection servers throughout the network, live context-based steering of experiment behaviour, and live context-based control of the measurement collection process itself. We finish by comparing our architecture to existing work.},

    abstract = {In this paper we present ORBIT measurement framework and library (OML), which is a distributed software framework enabling real-time collection of data in a large distributed environment. The success of a multiuser distributed testbed facility depends largely on the ease of use, remote access as well as on the ease of collecting useful measurements from experimental runs. OML provides a flexible and dynamic way in which data is collected and made available for realtime access to the experimenters. Application programmers can use simple interfaces provided to transfer measurements and other performance data to a central repository. This paper focuses on the motivation, requirements, design, implementation and real world usage of OML that is designed to provide a scalable, controllable and easy to use mechanism for experimenters to collect useful results from the experiments conducted on the ORBIT testbed.},

@book{ref_1997knuth_taocp_v2e3_p232,
    abstract = {Volume 2 of Donald Knuth's classic series \_The Art of Computer Programming\_
covers seminumerical algorithms, with topics ranging from random number
generators to floating point operations and other optimized arithmetic
algorithms. Truly comprehensive and meticulously written, this book (and
series) is that rarest of all creatures--a work of authoritative scholarship
in classical computer science, but one that can be read and used profitably by
virtually all working programmers.

The book begins with fundamental questions regarding random numbers and how to
use algorithms to generate them. Subsequent chapters demonstrate efficient
computation of single-precision and double-precision arithmetic calculations
and modular arithmetic. The text then presents prime factorization (which can
be used in cryptography, for instance) and algorithms for calculating
fractions. This volume ends with algorithms for polynomial arithmetic and
manipulation of power-series topics, which will benefit those with some
knowledge of calculus.

Throughout this beautifully presented edition, Knuth incorporates hundreds of
useful exercises for trying out the algorithms. These range from simple
problems to larger research project topics. (The book provides answers, where
appropriate, at the end of the book.) The result is a text that's suitable for
college or graduate-level computer science courses or individual study by
programmers. Volume 2 is an indispensable part of any working programmer's
library.},
